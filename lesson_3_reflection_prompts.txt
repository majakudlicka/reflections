When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with others on the same project or if for whatever reason; i am working from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don’t want your local version to be overwritten by someone else’s changes before making sure these changes are valid.
